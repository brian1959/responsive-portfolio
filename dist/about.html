                <p>I grew up as an "Air Force Brat." 
                    I was born in France, lived in Ohio, Michigan, Taiwan and California.
                This experience taught me how to make friends and helped me become an outgoing 
            individual. I enjoy playing sports, spending time with family and being with people. </p>

                <h6>Annual Portland to Coast Race</h6>
                <p>Each summer in August, a relay race is held in Portland, Oregon.  It is a 130 mile race of 400 teams the stretches from
                    Portland to Seaside, Oregon.  I have participated in this race.  I love the competition and push myself
                    to walk as fast as I can.  My personal best is an average pace of 10:50 per mile
                    for 4 miles.

                <p>As a young boy my mother shared with me stories about her parents and grandparents.
                    My father was only able to say that he knew nothing about his father, because he 
                was dead.  This sparked an interest in finding out more about my heritage. Aftermore than 30 years
            and a DNA test, I was able to find out who my grandfather was learn about my Irish ancestors.<!DOCTYPE html>

                <h6>Board of Directors for Zarephath Ministries</h6>
                <p>I served on the Board of Directors for a non-profit food pantry and
                    soup kitchen in Gresham, Oregon.  It is an all volunteer organization with no 
                    consistant funding.  I helped to organize an annual fund rasing activity and
                    establish budgeting guidelines. We served over 150 lunch meals each day and 
                    provided a 3 day food basket to 30 families each day.
